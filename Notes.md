Important: <br/>
This was created in the pre-production stage of the game (and updated during development), so, keep in mind that a lot of things presented here might not be in the final game.

# Theme
###### ABERRATION
###### a departure from what is normal, usual or expected, typically one that is unwelcome.

Games will be judged on 4 separate criteria: 
- Gameplay, 
- Presentation, 
- Theme, 
- Originality.

---

## Goal
My goal in this (my first) game jam is to deliver a finished and playable game.
I don't care about winning or doing great in the community ranking, 
I just want to actually finish a playable game.

### Game Ideas:
- The protagonist is **the aberration** that grows/expands consuming normal people. 
  OR: shrinks over time and have to consume things to grow.
    - Probably the most used idea.
    - More casual like Agario.

- The protagonist is a **fighter** that tries to extinguish The Aberration while searching for a "**cure**".
    - Action based game. 
    - Lot's of levels with enemies and bosses.
    - More focused on the gameplay and not on the narrative.

- The protagonist is **different** from it's kind, so in the game they search for ways to be "**normal**".
    - Focused on the narrative.

- The protagonist is a detective that must identify what is the Aberration they are dealing with and must anihilate it.
    - Inspired by Paranormal Order.

### Final Idea:
Protagonist is different (his color is different) from others of its kind. 
(They are seen as an **Aberration**)
Then they go on a quest for change. Searching for ways to **become like the others**.
In this quest, they must **collect "items"** that help they change.
Returning, fully transformed, they realize people **still dont accept** them. 
Then, they discover that everybody is **pretending** to be like the king just to please him.

### Basic Story Structures
###### Idea
The story is about a group of characters accepting their differences because that is what makes them unique.

###### Conflict
The main conflict of the story is the way the protagonist is not welcome among others because of their color. 

###### Character
The main character is a nameless, genderless slime.
They are sad because of being unwelcome in their own "home".

###### Dramatic Action
The story will be told through short cutscenes and small dialogues.
An intro cutscene -> Gameplay (with dialogues) -> Outro cutscene.

###### Dramatic Time
The story will be linear and pretty fast 
(because it will be told through initial and ending dialogues).

---

### Context / Experience
In the beginning, the experience is aiming towards making the player feel sad and hopeless.

During the most part of the gameplay, the quest, the player must feel empowered 
(because the character is evolving). 

Towards the end, when the reveal occurs, the mood changes to something warmer. 

---

### High Concept
> Basic Action
> The player go through levels collecting "things"...

> Short Term Progression
> ... that changes the character... 

> Mid Term Progression
> ... to be fully transformed into someone else...

> Aspiration
> ... to be accepted by the others.

---

### Three Keywords

1 - Unwelcoming
2 - Movement
3 - Acceptance

---

### Hero's Journey
> 1 - The Ordinary World
> The player wanders through it's "home" where they are different from everyone else.

> 2 - The Call to Adventure
> Player finds the (locked) gate that leads to "unknown lands"

> 3 - Refusal of the Call
> Player cannot go past the gate since the rule is to show any simmilarity with the others.

> 4 - Meeting the Mentor
> Instead of a mentor, it's just the player going to another direction and finding the first piece of "thing".

> 5 - Crossing the Threshold
> The player go through the gates but is warned that only those of the same kind can enter the village.

> 6 - Tests, Allies and Enemies (Ventre da Baleia)
> Player goes through the levels collecting the "things" and becoming more and more like the others.

> 7 - The Approach
> The player is almost fully transformed and in one of the levels they find a group of people similar to them. But they judge how the player is turning to something else instead of being proud of who they are.
This group of blue people may also be originally from the "village/home" but were kicked by "the king" and his followers.

> 8 - The Ordeal (Provação Suprema)
> Maybe a boss battle

> 9 - The Reward
> Player grab the last "thing" and gets fully transformed

> 10 - The Road Back
> Player can finally go back to the village/home since they are now fully transformed

> 11 - The Ressurrection
> Player realizes that everyone is pretending to be what they are just to please the king. 
Then, encourages everyone to be themselves. 
When that happens, they ban the king for being a piece of sh*t...

> 12 - Return with the Elixir
> The player and everyone get rid of the "transformation" and now accept how they truly are. 

---

### Sequence of Events
###### 1. Tutorial
> Player wakes up in a big landscape where the "tutorial" starts.
A reference is Hollow Knight's left side of Dirtmouth.
The tutorial consists of a simple fading text that shows the controls to walk and jump. 

###### 2. The Village
> Going to the right, the player finds the village with all of the "different" people.
In the village there won't be much to do except dialog options.
Those dialogs are important to show the player how much the protagonist is not welcome.
Maybe animate some of the npc's running from the player or not looking towards the player.

###### 3. The Gate
> In the far right of the village, there will be this great gate with a guard keeping it.
The guard will tell the player that only those who are similar to his kind cross it.

###### 4. Turning back
> Having no option, the player is forced to explore the other side 
(the far left, from where the game starts).
There, the player will find the first piece of "thing" that can transform a part of them.

###### 5. Crossing the Gate
> The player now crosses the gate and is advised that they cannot come back because only those of the same color can enter the village.

###### 6. Level 1 Starts
> The player enters officialy in the game (at least where the majority of the game will happen) in this celeste-like platformer. 
The player must collect pieces of "thing" in the levels to be able to transform and be accepted in the village.

> Notes during gameplay:
> she went left first. (which leads to a problem)
> confused with the key to interact.
> she didn't notice the door without the lock and accidentaly pressed up, so she got confused with why the level changed.
> stuck in the wall jump (scene 2)
> in scene 3 she is bumping the character on the first block with spikes. maybe i should lower the second single block so it doesnt happen. and maybe add a checkpoint to the block with the walljumps.
> maybe tweak the character movement a little bit so it stops faster (when not pressing anything)

3.
Tester: Sayuri.
Sequence: from start to end.
Disclaimers: there is still transitions between levels.

> Feedbacks on the Gameplay:
> 8/10 -> not 10 because the jumping mechanic is really hard.

> Feedbacks on the Presentation:
> 10/10

> Feedbacks on the Theme:
> 9/10 -> not 10 because there should be more references to being a freak, something related "to the red ones"

> General Feedbacks:
> in the last scene, transition from the light to the credits.

### Quick Ideas:

The character can only go past the Home into the Levels 
if he shows something in common with the other people 
(the gate is locked by an old gate keeper)
-> this makes the player have to go Left, and find the firt piece of "thing"
then the gate keeper let the player go because... he doesnt care that much

the "home/village" is for the red people and the player only gets a little space to sleep
(this can be shown only in environment or cutscene if able to make it, like link waking in the bed)

the "home/village" have:
- houses
- lots of red people
- the king
- the gate in the barrier to access the levels
- player can wall jump after finding special item (to access first Thing).
