### Quick Ideas:

The character can only go past the Home into the Levels 
if he shows something in common with the other people 
(the gate is locked by an old gate keeper)
-> this makes the player have to go Left, and find the firt piece of "thing"
then the gate keeper let the player go because... he doesnt care that much

the "home/village" is for the red people and the player only gets a little space to sleep
(this can be shown only in environment or cutscene if able to make it, like link waking in the bed)

the "home/village" have:
- houses
- lots of red people
- the king
- the gate in the barrier to access the levels
