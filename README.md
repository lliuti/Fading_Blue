## About the Project
This game was made for [Acerola Jam 0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0 "Game Jam's Itch.io page"). <br/>
All of the artwork, coding and sounds were made by me. <br/>
It is also the first complete game I have ever made. <br/>

### The theme
This Game Jam's theme was: "Aberration". <br/>
"a departure from what is normal, usual, or expected, typically one that is unwelcome."

When reading the word's definition, "unwelcome" stuck with me. <br/>
Then I started to brainstorm some ideas with that in mind. 

The idea I liked the most was about the journey of self acceptance. <br/>
I realised this would lead to a more narrative focused game. <br/>
The way I dealt with it was telling the story through NPC dialogues.

### How to play
You can visit the [game's Itch.io page](https://lliuti.itch.io/fading-blue "Fading Blue") to download the game and run it. <br/>
Don't worry if you get hit with windows' SmartScreen trying to block the game, you can click on "More info" and "Run Anyways".

The controls are pretty straightforward:
- Move: A & D or Left Arrow & Right Arrow.
- Jump: Spacebar or Z.
- Interact: W or Up Arrow.
- Pause Menu: Escape.

### Credits
The only third party asset used in this game was the font. <br/>
It is called [Thaleah](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/fonts/free-pixel-font-thaleah-140059 "Unity asset store page") and was made by Tiny Worlds.
